# Default_loan_predictor
Background: For financial ins1tu1ons, the ability to predict loan defaults is a cri1cal factor
in managing financial risk, maintaining profitability, and ensuring sustainable growth.
Defaulted loans can significantly disrupt the financial health of an ins1tu1on, as they lead to
substan1al losses and may poten1ally affect the ins1tu1on's credibility. Tradi1onal risk
assessment methods, which largely rely on a borrower's credit score, income, and collateral,
have not been en1rely efficient in predic1ng loan defaults. This inefficiency could be
aFributed to their inability to capture complex paFerns and rela1onships in the data,
thereby necessita1ng a more advanced approach.



Problem: The candidate needs to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaul1ng on a loan
using a machine learning model. This model should consider a variety of factors that
poten1ally influence a borrower's ability to repay a loan, such as income, employment
status, credit score, loan amount, interest rate, and other relevant variables. The predic1on
model should also handle data imbalances, missing values, and outliers effec1vely.
Second, the ability to address the problem, including the understanding of the problem, the
proposed solu1on, the ability to build a predic1ve model, and the understanding of machine
learning algorithms, data analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model
evalua1on methods.
